/**
 * The shell every screen is inside, and the routing table.
 *
 * ── Why there is a shell at all ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * A first slice demonstrated on a browser-default page gets feedback about the page. Header, main and
 * footer, styled from `src/styles/`, mean the first thing anybody sees is a page — and the slice is what
 * is being looked at. It is deliberately generic: a baseline to react to, not a design. `docs/design.md`
 * is where this project writes down what it decided instead.
 *
 * ── Why the flags are awaited here and not before `createRoot` ────────────────────────────────────────
 * `flagEnabled` answers off until it has been told otherwise, so rendering a gated screen before the flags
 * arrive shows every gated feature in its off state and then changes its mind — a flash of the wrong
 * screen on every load, for the one flag that is on.
 *
 * The fix used to be a top-level `await` in `main.tsx`, which bought that at the cost of the whole page:
 * nothing at all painted until the request came back, so a slow or dead service was a blank tab. Waiting
 * *here* is the same guarantee where it is actually needed — the shell paints immediately, and only the
 * routed content waits. `loadFlags` never rejects, so the wait is bounded by one request either way.

 * Hand this bundle its flags, once, and say when that has happened.
 *
 * `setFlagSource` is module state rather than a context on purpose (`src/flags.ts` says why), so this
 * returns a boolean rather than the flags themselves: a slice asks `flagEnabled('checkout-v2')` wherever
 * it needs to, and nothing has to be threaded through the tree.
