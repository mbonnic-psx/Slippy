#
# On GitHub, with a short-lived OIDC token and no stored credential at all: the trust names this
# repository's main branch and its two deployment environments and nothing else, so a fork, a pull request
# or another repository in the same organisation cannot assume the role. On a forge without OIDC federation
# (Gitea), an IAM user whose only permission is to assume this role, its access key stored as the
# repository's secrets — the weaker shape, and still one role as the permission boundary. `make bootstrap`
# picks by reading the repository's remote.

  # nothing — `Not authorized to perform sts:AssumeRoleWithWebIdentity`, with a trust policy that reads
