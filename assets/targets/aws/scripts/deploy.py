"""The production verbs the Makefile hands off to: push, smoke, deploy, rollback, migrate.

Each `make` target is one line and this is where the lines meet: reading `project.json` for what the
services are, running `tofu` and the `aws` CLI, and keeping the release record that makes a rollback a single
automated action rather than an archaeology exercise. Dependency-free on purpose — Python 3 is already what
every gate in this repository runs on — and every external command it runs is printed before it runs, so a
failure reads as the command that failed.

    scripts/deploy.py push <name>=<image> ...         push each built image, record the digests in .build/images.json
    scripts/deploy.py smoke-image <name>=<image> ...  run each built image locally and prove its probe answers
    scripts/deploy.py deploy <env>                    migrate, apply the service stack, upload the site, record the release
    scripts/deploy.py rollback <env>                  re-apply the release before the current one
    scripts/deploy.py promote [<commit>]              ask the forge to deploy production with what staging runs
    scripts/deploy.py promoting <env> [<commit>]      print the commit that would be promoted, and nothing else
    scripts/deploy.py migrate <env>                   run each service's migrations inside the environment
    scripts/deploy.py smoke <url>                     prove a deployed environment answers
    scripts/deploy.py url <env>                       print the environment's address
    scripts/deploy.py flag <env> <service> <k> <v>    set one feature flag, restart what reads it, smoke it
    scripts/deploy.py flags <env>                     print every flag, its value, and who set it when

`deploy`, `rollback`, `migrate` and `url` need `TOFU_STATE_BUCKET` and `AWS_REGION` in the environment — the
identifiers the bootstrap stack printed — and AWS credentials the way any AWS tool finds them. `promote`
needs neither: it asks the forge to run `.github/workflows/production.yml`, and the runner does the work
with the deploy role, which is why promoting from a laptop is not the same as applying from one.

    The first two steps are what the shape buys everywhere else: the value reaches the container as an
    environment variable ECS resolves when a task *starts*, so tasks already running are holding the old
    one. `--force-new-deployment` is a blue/green deploy of the revision already deployed — new tasks come
    up beside the old, pass their health checks, take the traffic, and the old ones drain — so a flip costs
    no build, no apply and no merge to `main`, but it does cost the couple of minutes that takes.

    The last two steps are that couple of minutes spent rather than guessed at. A flip is a production
    change made with no `verify`, no review and no pipeline behind it, so the one cheap thing available is
    to wait for the deployment it already forces and then ask the environment the same question a deploy
    asks: `services-stable`, then `smoke`. It smokes the environment's public address — the site where
    there is one — which is what a deploy smokes; it is not a test of the feature the flag just revealed,
    and the person who flipped it still has to look.

    Nothing about this reaches the release record `deploy` keeps: a release names a commit and its images,
    and a flag flipped afterwards is not in it. `flags` below is where an environment's current answer
    lives, and it is the only place it lives.
