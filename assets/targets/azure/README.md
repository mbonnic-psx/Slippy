# Infrastructure: the path to production

Two OpenTofu stacks, and two scripts the Makefile hands the production verbs to.

| Directory | What it is | Who applies it |
|---|---|---|
| `bootstrap/` | The state storage account, the pipeline's identity (a user-assigned managed identity with three federated credentials on GitHub, or an app registration with a client secret on a forge without OIDC), and the container registry every service's images go to. Its own state is committed here, encrypted. | `make bootstrap` — a person, once, signed in as an Owner of the subscription. Not needed again when a service is added. |
| `service/` | Everything an environment is: one Container App per application behind the environment's own ingress, and whatever the answers asked for — the database, the staff identity, the site. `staging` and `production` are workspaces over this one directory, each in a resource group of its own. | The pipeline, on every push to `main`. `make deploy ENV=…` runs the same code path from a laptop. |
| `../scripts/bootstrap.py` | What `make bootstrap` runs: reads the forge from the remote, applies `bootstrap/`, writes the outputs to the repository as variables and a secret. `--plan` says what it would do. | `make bootstrap`. |
| `../scripts/deploy.py` | `push`, `smoke-image`, `deploy`, `rollback`, `promote`, `migrate`, `smoke`, `url` — the verbs behind the other production targets. | Whatever runs `make`. |

`docs/deployment.md` draws what these stacks provision for the project's own services, and is regenerated with
them; `docs/adr/0002-production-target.md` is why each part is what it is, and what it costs.

## Before `./init`

`./init` does this project's first day: it installs Spec Kit, then asks for the repository to push to,
pushes `main`, and runs `make bootstrap` against your Azure subscription — so the push is the first deploy,
and everything below is what that last step needs. Have all of it on the machine that runs `./init`. A later
`make bootstrap` wants the same list, except that row 7 is then a passphrase to supply rather than one to
keep.

| | Have | What needs it | Proof it is there |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | **Python 3**, and **`uv`** or network access for `pip` | Spec Kit is installed with one of them, and every script under `scripts/` is Python | `uv --version` · `python3 --version` |
| 2 | **OpenTofu 1.12**, on the PATH as `tofu` | applies `bootstrap/` now and `service/` on every deploy after | `tofu version` |
| 3 | **The `az` CLI, signed in as an Owner** of the subscription this project will live in — `az login`, then `az account set --subscription <id>` where there is more than one | `bootstrap/` creates a storage account, an identity and a registry, and then *grants the pipeline its roles*. Granting access is not something Contributor may do, which is why Owner rather than Contributor | `az account show` names that subscription |
| 4 | **A region** — `export AZURE_LOCATION=uksouth`, or `az config set defaults.location=uksouth` — unless `infra/location` is already committed | Azure has no ambient region: every resource carries a location, so this is a value the stacks cannot be applied without. It is written to `infra/location`, which every later `make bootstrap`, `make deploy` and `make url` reads | `az config get defaults.location` |
| 5 | **Access to your forge.** GitHub: `gh` on the PATH and signed in. Gitea: `GITEA_TOKEN` set to a token with `read:user` and `write:repository` — plus `write:organization` if the repository will belong to an organisation | it creates the repository, private, if it is not there, and writes the variables and the secret the pipeline signs in to Azure with | `gh auth status` · `echo ${GITEA_TOKEN:+set}` |
| 6 | **The repository's URL**, if `origin` is not set yet — `https://github.com/<owner>/<name>`, `http://localhost:3300/<owner>/<name>` — and whatever a `git push` to it needs | the pipeline is configured on the forge, so the bootstrap has to know which repository this is | `git remote get-url origin` |
| 7 | **Somewhere to keep a passphrase.** The first `make bootstrap` generates one and prints it once; every run after it needs the same one back in `TF_VAR_state_passphrase` | it encrypts `bootstrap/terraform.tfstate`, which is committed to this repository | a password manager |

**Directory rights, where the subscription's are not enough.** Everything in row 3 is *subscription* RBAC,
and an app registration is not a subscription resource: it is a **directory** object, outside that RBAC
entirely. Owner of the subscription grants nothing there. Two of this project's answers need directory
rights as well, and the bootstrap refuses before it applies rather than halfway through:

- **On a forge without OIDC federation** — Gitea, and anything else `make bootstrap` cannot federate — the
  pipeline signs in with an app registration and a client secret, so the bootstrap creates an application
  and its service principal. The caller needs to be able to create both: **Application Developer** is the
  least role that allows it, and Application Administrator, Cloud Application Administrator or Global
  Administrator all include it. On GitHub none of this applies: the pipeline federates, and the identity it
  becomes is a user-assigned managed identity, which *is* a subscription resource.
- **Where this project answered `--auth entra`**, the caller also needs to be able to grant an application
  permission — a **Privileged Role Administrator** or a Global Administrator. The stack grants the deploy
  identity the narrow `Application.ReadWrite.OwnedBy` Graph role, which is what makes the staff identity a
  thing the pipeline can provision, and it grants nothing else in the directory. A project with
  `--auth none` needs none of this, and the stack asks for none of it.

`az rest --method GET --url 'https://graph.microsoft.com/v1.0/me/memberOf?$select=displayName'` lists the
directory roles the signed-in account actually holds, which is the answer to both.

**One more, only where this project answered `--auth auth0` or `--users auth0`:** an **Auth0 tenant**, and
one **machine-to-machine application** inside it authorised for the Auth0 Management API — allowed to read
and write clients, connections, resource servers and roles. Auth0 is a third party: the deploy identity
this bootstrap creates owns everything else in the stack and owns nothing there, so `infra/service/auth0.tf`
is applied with that application's own credentials. `make bootstrap` asks for `AUTH0_DOMAIN`,
`AUTH0_CLIENT_ID` and `AUTH0_CLIENT_SECRET` (or takes them from the environment), puts the first two on the
forge as variables and the third as a secret, and the deploy workflows pass all three to `tofu`. There is no
API for creating a tenant, which is why those two things are yours to make and everything inside them is the
pipeline's. A project that answered neither axis with Auth0 is asked for none of it, and carries no Auth0
provider at all.

Nothing is applied until all of it is there, and a gap is found before the work rather than halfway through
it:

- **When the project was generated**, rows 2–5 were checked on that machine — `generate` refuses `--target
  azure` without them, unless `--skip-checks` said another machine would run `./init`.
- **At the top of `./init`**, before Spec Kit is installed: `tofu`, `az`, and `gh` or `GITEA_TOKEN`. Missing
  one, it names it, does the rest of the local work anyway, and leaves the push and the bootstrap for later
  — `./init --repository <url>` once it is there, or push and `make bootstrap`. `./init --skip-bootstrap`
  leaves them deliberately.
- **Inside `make bootstrap`**, before the apply: the tools again; the location, asked once in a terminal if
  nothing else says and written to `infra/location`; who the CLI is signed in as, printed; and which roles
  that sign-in holds on the subscription — short of Owner it refuses naming them, having applied nothing.
  `scripts/bootstrap.py --plan` prints every one of those decisions and changes nothing.
- **How production is deployed**, asked once in a terminal by `make bootstrap` if nothing else says, and
  written to `infra/auto-promote`: `true` — the default — deploys production on every commit that passes
  `verify` on `main`; `false` deploys staging on every green push and leaves production to `make promote`.
  `make bootstrap AUTO_PROMOTE=true|false` or `./init --auto-promote …` answers ahead, and either way the
  answer reaches the forge as the `AUTO_PROMOTE` variable, which is the only thing `deploy.yml` reads to
  decide.

An environment costs money from the moment it exists, and turning auto-promotion off is what leaves
production uncreated until `make promote`; `docs/adr/0002-production-target.md` says how much.

## Bootstrap, once

The first commit carries the pipeline and the infrastructure. What it cannot carry is the subscription:
someone signed in as an Owner has to create the place state lives, the identity the pipeline becomes, and
the registry images go to, and then tell the repository where they are. That is `make bootstrap`, and
`./init` runs it: after installing Spec Kit it asks for the repository to push to (created on the forge if
it is not there — `gh` on GitHub, `GITEA_TOKEN` on Gitea), pushes `main`, and bootstraps. `./init
--repository <url>` answers ahead; `./init --skip-bootstrap` leaves it for later, when it is one command:

```sh
git remote add origin <your repository> && git push -u origin main   # the pipeline is configured on the forge
make bootstrap
```

Once. A later `./init` — to answer an axis again, add an extension, or switch agent — finds
`bootstrap/terraform.tfstate` committed, says so, and leaves the subscription alone; it needs no
credentials. Re-applying the stack is `make bootstrap`, run by hand with the passphrase.

Everything it needs is the table above. `make bootstrap REPOSITORY=owner/name FORGE=github|gitea|none`
overrides what it reads from the remote; `scripts/bootstrap.py --plan` prints its decisions and changes
nothing.

What it does, in order:

1. Settles the location (asking once, if nothing says), then reads the sign-in and says which subscription
   and identity it is using, and refuses if that identity is not an Owner of it.
2. Generates the passphrase that encrypts the committed bootstrap state — on a first run; afterwards it
   needs the same one in `TF_VAR_state_passphrase` — and prints it once at the end. Keep it in a password
   manager. Nothing but a later `make bootstrap` ever needs it.
3. Applies `bootstrap/`. On GitHub the pipeline will sign in with a federated credential and no stored
   credential at all; the credentials name this repository and nothing else, spelled the way GitHub spells
   it in the token — the script asks the repository's OIDC customization endpoint for the `sub` prefix,
   since a repository created after 15 July 2026 is `repo:owner@<id>/name@<id>` rather than
   `repo:owner/name` — and it creates **three**, because GitHub describes a job by its ref
   (`:ref:refs/heads/main`) only when the job declares no `environment:`, and by the environment
   (`:environment:staging`, `:environment:production`) when it does. Every job that deploys here declares
   one, and Entra matches a subject exactly with no wildcards, so all three have to be there. On Gitea, or
   any forge without OIDC federation, it creates an app registration, its service principal and one client
   secret instead.
4. Writes the outputs to the repository: variables `AZURE_LOCATION`, `AZURE_SUBSCRIPTION_ID`,
   `AZURE_TENANT_ID`, `AZURE_CLIENT_ID`, `AZURE_REGISTRY_ID`, `AZURE_REGISTRY_NAME`,
   `TOFU_STATE_RESOURCE_GROUP`, `TOFU_STATE_ACCOUNT`, `TOFU_STATE_CONTAINER` and `IMAGE_REGISTRY` —
   identifiers, not confidential — and, on a forge without OIDC, the secret `AZURE_CLIENT_SECRET`. The
   generated `deploy.yml` takes both shapes and uses the secret only when one is present. It also writes
   the same identifiers into `infra/` as plain files, so a laptop with none of them in its environment can
   still run `make deploy` and `make url` from a checkout. On GitHub it creates the `staging` and
   `production` environments, each with a deployment branch policy naming `main`. That is what holds the
   environment subjects above to this branch: they carry no ref of their own, so without it a job on any
   branch could declare `environment: staging` and become the deploy identity. Run again, an environment
   that is already there and already names `main` is left as it is; a forge that refuses the call —
   environment protection rules need a paid plan on a private repository — says so and says what is left to
   set under Settings → Environments. Gitea has no environments API and no OIDC subject to hold, so the
   step is skipped there.
5. Tells you to commit `bootstrap/terraform.tfstate`, `bootstrap/.terraform.lock.hcl`, the `infra/` files
   it wrote and `infra/auto-promote`, and push.

The push that follows is the first deploy, once `verify` has passed on it: build, push by digest, apply
`staging`, smoke, apply `production`, smoke. Both environments exist already, made by `make bootstrap` with
the branch policy the federated credentials depend on. Without auto-promotion that first deploy stops after
staging and production is not created at all; `make promote` is what creates it, whenever this project
wants it.

## Every commit that passes verify on main

`.github/workflows/deploy.yml` starts when `verify.yml` completes on `main` (a `workflow_run`), and only
goes on if it passed — so the deploy never runs beside the gate or ahead of it, and a commit the gate failed
is never applied. Then: `make build push` once, `make deploy ENV=staging`, `make smoke`, `make deploy
ENV=production`, `make smoke`. Every job checks out the commit `verify` passed rather than the head of
`main`, which a later push may already have moved; that later push gets its own verify run and its own
deploy, queued behind this one. The deploy jobs need nothing from the build job — `scripts/deploy.py` finds
the commit's images in the registry by tag — so the workflow uses no artifact store and runs on GitHub
Actions and Gitea Actions alike (`workflow_run` needs Gitea 1.24 or later).

The production job carries one condition, `vars.AUTO_PROMOTE != 'false'`, and that variable is the whole of
the choice: `true` (or a repository with no such variable) runs it, `false` skips it and leaves production
to the workflow below. There is no approval step either way — declining auto-promotion is a project
deciding it has no production yet, or wants a person to say when, not a gate inside this pipeline.

`.github/workflows/production.yml`: started by `make promote` or by hand from the Actions tab. It resolves
the commit staging is running from staging's own release record, checks *that* commit out, and runs `make
deploy ENV=production` and `make smoke`. Nothing is built: the images it deploys are the ones staging has
already run, found in the registry by the commit's tag. Given a commit explicitly it refuses any that
staging has no release of, so this is not a way round the gate. It is also how production is created in a
project that does not auto-promote — until it first runs, that workspace is empty and `make url
ENV=production` says so.

`.github/workflows/rollback.yml`: started by hand from the Actions tab, with the environment to roll back.
It runs `make rollback ENV=…` and `make smoke`, builds nothing, and shares the deploy's concurrency group so
the two never overlap. The next push to `main` deploys forward again — a rollback buys time to fix `main`.

## What a deploy does to a revision

A deploy is a new revision of each container app. It starts beside the one serving and takes no requests
until its readiness probe passes; when it does, it takes all of them at once. The release before stops
receiving traffic — whether it goes on *running* is `kept_revisions` in the environment's tfvars: one in
production, so a rollback is a change of traffic weight and costs an extra replica for as long as it is
kept; none in staging, so a rollback starts the previous image again instead.

The revision's name is the platform's hash of what it runs, not the commit. A revision suffix has to be
unique for the lifetime of a container app and `make rollback` re-runs a commit that has already had one,
so naming revisions after commits would make the second rollback a name collision. Which commit a revision
runs is the image tag on it, and the release records in the state container are the rest of that answer.

## Schema changes

A deploy overlaps, so for a while the release before and the release after run against one database — and
`rollback.yml` puts the release before back without touching the schema. Both are safe under
expand/contract, which `make check-migrations` holds every migration to: add first (a table, a nullable
column, a default), in one deployment; remove or reshape in a later one, in a migration that names the
expand it completes (`-- contract: 003_orders_add_status`). `make deploy` runs the migrations *before* the
new revision rolls, where the backend runs them as a job, so the expand is in place when the new release
arrives.

The migration runs as a Container Apps job in the same environment as the apps, started by
`scripts/deploy.py` and waited on. The database admits Azure services and not a laptop, which is why
`make migrate-remote` runs the job rather than connecting from a terminal.

## From a laptop

The same verbs, with the identifiers `make bootstrap` wrote into `infra/` and an `az` sign-in:

```sh
az login                                       # everything else is read from infra/ or the environment
make build smoke-image PLATFORM=linux/arm64   # the images, run locally and asked their probe
make build push                               # into the registry, digests recorded in .build/images.json
make deploy ENV=staging                       # apply, migrate, upload the site, record the release
make smoke URL=$(make -s url ENV=staging)
make rollback ENV=staging                      # the release before this one
make promote                                   # ask the forge to deploy production with what staging runs
```

Production is the pipeline's to deploy; `make deploy ENV=production` exists so the code path is one, not so
that it is used. `make promote` is the exception that proves it: it applies nothing itself, it asks the
forge to start `production.yml`, and the runner does the apply with the deploy identity. It needs no Azure
sign-in — on GitHub it uses `gh`, on Gitea a `GITEA_TOKEN` with write access — and `make promote
COMMIT=<sha>` promotes a specific release staging has run, rather than the newest.

## Feature flags

A flag is the one thing about a running environment that changes without a deploy. Declare it in
`service/flags.auto.tfvars`, seeded at whatever the service already does, and it reaches the container as
`FLAG_<KEY>` — a Key Vault secret Container Apps resolves when a replica starts, exactly the way it
resolves any other secret, so no image carries an Azure SDK for it.

```sh
make flags ENV=staging                                   # what this environment is actually set to
make flag ENV=staging KEY=checkout-v2 VALUE=on           # write it, then restart what reads it
```

Three things to know. A flip is a rolling restart, not a live re-read: around two minutes, with no build, no
apply and no merge to `main` — but replicas already running hold the old value until they are replaced.
The secret, not the file, is the truth once an environment exists: `flags.tf` stops managing the value the
moment it has seeded it, so neither the next deploy nor `make rollback` puts a flipped flag back, and
editing the seed changes nothing in an environment that already has one. And `make flags` says what a flag
is set to and when it last moved, but not *who* moved it: Key Vault keeps a version's timestamps and not
its author, so if that answer is needed, turn on the vault's diagnostic logging.

### And a browser app

A browser app reads the same flag by asking the service for it, over `GET /api/flags` — the service answers
from the environment these secrets land in, so one product flag has one name and one value on both sides of
`/api`. A flip is the service's restart and nothing else: a browser already open picks the new value up on
its next load, and `make flag` says that no deploy is owed. `apps/<web>/src/flags.ts` is that side of it,
and `flagEnabled('checkout-v2')` is how the app asks; a flag is declared under the service the site's `/api`
goes to, which is the service that answers for it.

It was not always this way, and the reason is worth keeping. The bundle used to be built with
`VITE_FLAG_<KEY>` inlined from this environment's values, because Vite inlines a `VITE_`-prefixed value
while the bundle is *built*. That gave one product flag two clocks — the service's moving in a restart, the
browser's only on the next deploy — and every gated screen carried an ordering rule (on in the service
first, off in the bundle first) that existed only because of how the value arrived. Asking the service
removes the second clock and the rule with it.

`make rollback` no longer diverges here either. It restores the previous release's bundle, and that bundle
carries no flag values at all, so both halves read whatever this environment is set to now — which is what a
rollback should leave alone, the secret being the one place a flip is recorded.

A flag that has to take effect *without* a restart is the other transport, and it is a per-environment
answer rather than a per-project one: set `flag_transport = "appconfig"` in `service/staging.tfvars` or
`service/production.tfvars` and that environment gets an Azure App Configuration store, read by the
application under its own managed identity, with a flip that takes effect in seconds and no restart at all.
`keyvault` stays the default everywhere, so an environment takes it on when a flag actually needs it.

Three things change with it, and all three are worth knowing before you set it. **The application gains an
SDK** — `@azure/app-configuration` in the image — because Container Apps has no agent sidecar the way ECS
does; this is the one place this target is weaker than the AWS one, and it is why the transport is confined
to the backends that have a reader. **The application gains an Azure permission**, where under `keyvault`
the platform resolves the values before the process starts and the app never talks to Azure at all. And the
free tier of App Configuration allows **one store per subscription per region**, so a second environment
opting in needs the standard tier at roughly $36 a month. `infra/service/flags.tf` has the whole argument.

## Changing the stacks

### Renaming or retiring a resource

OpenTofu keys state by address, so renaming a resource block, or moving it into a `for_each` or a module,
reads as destroying the old address and creating a new one — unless a `moved` block says the two are one:

```hcl
moved {
  from = azurerm_container_app.api
  to   = azurerm_container_app.service
}
```

With it, the rename is an in-place update. Without it the apply creates the new resource, then destroys the
old one — and the old one's destroy is not ordered after the in-place update of whatever still uses it, so a
provider that refuses to delete something in use fails the apply part-way, in every
environment it reaches. A block that is only being dropped from the code, while what it made carries on
existing or is removed by hand, is a `removed` block (`removed { from = … lifecycle { destroy = false } }`),
which forgets it rather than deleting it. Both stay in the stack until every environment has been applied
past them; `tofu plan` showing `has moved to` or `will no longer be managed`, and no destroy, is the check.

## What lives where

- **Environment variables the services are given** — `service/main.tf`, composed from what each answer
  provisions; a secret (the database URL, the client secret) is a Key Vault reference Container Apps
  resolves when a replica starts.
- **Sizes** — `service/staging.tfvars` and `service/production.tfvars` for replicas and scaling;
  `database_sku`, `postgres_version`, `site_location`, the callback URLs and the rest have defaults in the
  file that owns them, overridable there too.
- **The services themselves** — `project.auto.tfvars.json`, written by the factory from `project.json` and
  rewritten by `add-service`. Do not edit it by hand; it is regenerated.
- **Feature flags** — declared in `service/flags.auto.tfvars`, one Key Vault secret per flag per
  environment, and the live value read with `make flags`. A flip is not in the release record below: that
  names a commit and its images, so "what was production running" is those two plus the flags at the time.
- **Releases** — `releases/<environment>/` in the state container, one JSON record per deploy, which is what
  a rollback reads; and `bundles/<environment>/` beside it, one archive of each release's built site, which
  is what a rollback puts back. The site is kept whole rather than as a pointer at hashed assets, because
  Static Web Apps replaces its content wholesale on every deployment.
