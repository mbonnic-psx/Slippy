"""`/cruise`'s settings, and the outer loop that re-invokes it with a fresh context until the specs are satisfied.

`.specify/cruise.json` holds how `/cruise` runs `commands/drive.md` with nobody at the wheel — who decides a
product question, how a slice is released, what a demo is driven with, when a run parks. This reads the file
and says what each setting is and controls, checks a hand edit, and changes them through `--set`, refusing
anything the command could not act on. `run` is the loop: one headless harness session per iteration, each a
fresh context, until the last line of an iteration says `done`, a person stops it, or nothing can move. It is
the one thing that continues a run, on every harness: a `/cruise` typed in a session starts it, detached,
with `start`, and the session that typed it runs no stage of the ladder.

    python3 scripts/agents/cruise.py                       # every setting and what it controls
    python3 scripts/agents/cruise.py --check               # well-formed; `make check-agents` runs this
    python3 scripts/agents/cruise.py --set enabled=true    # change settings, checked, any time
    python3 scripts/agents/cruise.py run [--feature F] [--no-park] [--sandbox]   # the loop; `make cruise`
    python3 scripts/agents/cruise.py start [--feature F] [--no-park] [--sandbox] # the loop, detached from this session
    python3 scripts/agents/cruise.py stop [--now]  # end the run after the iteration in flight, or now
    python3 scripts/agents/cruise.py status      # whether a runner is running, and what the log says it is doing
    python3 scripts/agents/cruise.py resume      # print the checkpoint into a compacted context; nothing when none
    python3 scripts/agents/cruise.py compacting  # stamp the checkpoint before the harness compacts
    python3 scripts/agents/cruise.py loop        # what is reading this session's last line: the runner, or nobody
    python3 scripts/agents/cruise.py stopping    # a harness's stop hook: refuse to end a runner's iteration early
    python3 scripts/agents/cruise.py responded   # a harness's after-response hook: keep the last message for `stopping`

`run` marks every session it starts with `CRUISE_RUNNER=1` and `CRUISE_ITERATION=<n>`, which is how `loop` and
`stopping` tell a runner's iteration from a `/cruise` a person typed — where nothing reads the last line, so the
command starts the runner instead of running the ladder itself.

Which harness an iteration runs through is the registry's `headless` column (`scripts/agents/registry.json`):
the first installed harness with a verified headless command whose binary is on PATH, else any harness in the
registry whose binary is, so a `/cruise` typed into an editor with no command line of its own still runs
through whichever CLI harness the machine has. `CRUISE_HARNESS_COMMAND` (a shell template with `{prompt}`)
overrides all of that, and `CRUISE_POLL_SECONDS` how long a parked loop waits, so a run can be rehearsed
against a fake harness.

A person stops a run with `touch .specify/cruise.stop` (`stop`), or by interrupting a foreground `run`: the
iteration under way is killed, its increment commits are on the slice branch, and the next iteration re-derives
from disk.

    go after HOLD_LIMIT holds with no rewrite in between — below every harness's own cap on consecutive
    holds, so it is this script that decides when to let go, and says so.

    The hold is spelled the way the harness reads it: Claude Code's `Stop` takes `{"decision": "block",
    "reason"}`, Cursor's `stop` takes `{"followup_message"}`, which it submits as the next user message. The
