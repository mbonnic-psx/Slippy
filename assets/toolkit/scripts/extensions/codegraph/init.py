"""`./init --extension codegraph`: install and index CodeGraph, and point the agent at it.

CodeGraph (https://github.com/colbymchenry/codegraph) is a local, 100%-offline MCP code-knowledge graph.
Its own installer already wires the MCP server into whichever coding agents it finds and appends its own
instruction block to their context files — but that config is the user's, on the one machine `./init` ran on,
and never reaches a container, a CI runner or the fresh session a `/cruise` iteration is. So this script does the
three things that belong to the project rather than to CodeGraph itself: index this repository, add one
marker-fenced pointer to `AGENTS.md` so the primary agent reaches for the graph on a cross-file question instead
of falling back to grep-and-read, and name the server in the committed project MCP file of every harness installed
here, so the connection travels with the checkout. The same block tells a delegated agent to probe its own session rather than assume it
inherited the primary agent's connection. The pointer says how to tell that an environment cannot reach
the index at all, because a checkout travels into
places its tooling does not, and `make check-codegraph` is what notices an index nothing is maintaining.
See docs/extensions.md for what every extension's `init.py` owes.

Never fails `./init`: a missing `codegraph` CLI is reported, not fatal.

## CodeGraph
This project is indexed by CodeGraph (`.codegraph/`). For any question about call paths, symbol usage, or
the blast radius of a change, query it directly — `codegraph_explore` over MCP, or the `codegraph` CLI —
before grep or reading files one at a time. Say which route you used when you report what you found.

**The connection travels with the checkout.** The project-scoped MCP file of every harness installed here
names the server, started through `npx` so a checkout with Node reaches the index whether or not the
`codegraph` CLI was ever installed there: `.mcp.json` for Claude Code, `.codex/config.toml` for Codex,
`.gemini/settings.json` for Gemini CLI, `.cursor/mcp.json` for Cursor, `opencode.json` for opencode. A `/cruise`
iteration is started with that file honoured and its tools allowed, `make agents` writes it for a harness added
later, and a harness with no known project file reaches the same index through the routes below.

**Check you can reach it before you trust it.** The index is data in this checkout; the tooling that
serves and maintains it is not, and a tree carried into a container, a sandbox or a CI runner routinely
has one without the other. Probe the available routes in order: use `codegraph_explore` when this session
offers it — treating a bare tool name as not loaded yet rather than unavailable, because a harness that
defers MCP tools lists `codegraph_explore` with no schema and refuses the call until you load it by name
through that harness's own tool-search step; otherwise use the installed CLI when
`command -v codegraph` succeeds; otherwise, when
`command -v npm` succeeds, use `npx -y @colbymchenry/codegraph explore <query>` to reach the same index
without installing the CLI globally. Only when all three routes are unavailable should you say so in as
many words ("the database is here, the tooling is not, so this answer is a text search"). Then work as a
project with no index would. Restore a durable connection by configuring the CodeGraph MCP server for this
project, or by installing the CLI and re-adopting the extension, which is what re-points the agent:
`curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/colbymchenry/codegraph/main/install.sh | sh` then
`./init --extension codegraph`.

**It is only current while a client is attached.** CodeGraph's watcher runs in a daemon that starts with
an MCP client or a `codegraph` command and shuts down on an idle timeout, so wherever the tooling is
absent the database stops being written to and nothing says so: it answers *nothing calls that* for code
it has never read, which is the failure it exists to prevent. `make check-codegraph`, part of `make
verify`, compares the index with the tracked source and fails with the date it was last written.
Attaching a client once — an MCP session, or `codegraph sync` in this directory — catches it up itself.

**A sub-agent does not inherit this session's connection.** A fresh delegate checks its own tools before
exploring and follows the same MCP, installed-CLI, then `npx` order. It says the index is unavailable
before falling back to text search only when none of those routes exists. Do not pass the parent
conversation merely to carry that fact — every harness receives this `AGENTS.md` block, while a delegate
keeps its focused stage brief. `commands/drive.md`, *Who runs each stage*, carries the same boundary.
