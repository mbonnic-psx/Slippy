"""Rebuild every committed dependency lock, one per dependency set the axes can produce.

Covers npm lockfiles for the TypeScript backend and the frontend, `uv.lock` for the Python backend, and
`go.mod`/`go.sum` for the Go backend. All three ecosystems have the same rule: a manifest and its
checksums have to be produced together, because the toolchain refuses a lock that disagrees with its
manifest.

`npm ci` refuses to install from a lockfile that disagrees with its package.json, so a generated project
cannot be handed a lockfile that is patched after the fact — the manifest and the lock have to be produced
together. That is why a lock is committed per combination rather than per project, and why this script
exists: the combinations multiply with every dependency-adding option, and building them by hand is how one
of them silently stops matching.

    python3 scripts/regenerate-locks.py            # every lock
    python3 scripts/regenerate-locks.py --check    # fail if any is stale, changing nothing

Needs network access, because resolving a dependency tree is what npm does here. `--package-lock-only` means
nothing is downloaded into a node_modules anywhere; only the resolution is written down.
