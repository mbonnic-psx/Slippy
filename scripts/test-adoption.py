"""Prove brownfield adoption end to end, on repositories shaped like the ones it will meet.

`docs/adopting.md` says `slipwai adopt` installs the delivery method around a repository the factory did not
make, that the gate it installs is green on day one, that adopting again changes nothing, and that a newer
factory later merges over the adopted repository as cleanly as over a generated one. Said and not gated, that
rots the way any asserted-only path does — so this takes each fixture under `tests/fixtures/adopt/` (one per
ecosystem the survey recognises, two in languages the factory cannot generate, one whose CI is GitLab's), makes
it a repository with history of its own, and holds the whole path to those claims: adopt commits once as the
factory and leaves the tree clean; `adopt --refresh` straight afterwards changes nothing;
`make -f delivery/Makefile verify` passes, red linter and all — a red suite stops the first run and is
quarantined only on request — where the fixture's toolchain is on
this machine (and says so where it is not); a GitLab repository gets a GitLab job and no GitHub workflow; a
newer factory's `migrate` is one clean merge that carries its change in and leaves the repository's own files
as they were; and the gate passes again afterwards. `make test-adoption` runs it; CI runs it as a job of its own.

Experimental, with the rest of adoption (`AGENTS.md` says what the word means here): a fixture that
fails here is the feedback loop working.
