    The two are one key rather than two independent axes because they do not combine independently: a
    framework that owns the composition root owns how every adapter behind every other axis is written,
    so `java` x `spring-boot` multiplies rather than crossing. Flattening it into the backend key is what
    keeps every per-backend table two-dimensional.

    The naming rule falls out of that, and it is about the framework rather than about how many siblings
    there are: **the bare language name means nothing owns startup, and a backend that has a framework is
    always suffixed with it** — as its family's only member just as much as beside a sibling. That is
    because `assets/languages/<family>/` holds the material a family shares, and a backend built around a
    framework is not that material even when it is the only one.

    The count-based version of this rule (bare while there is one member, suffixed once there are two) was
    the wrong shape for the ecosystems where a framework is the normal answer. It forced a new Java or C#
    backend to be keyed `java`, spelled as though nothing owned its startup, and then forced a rename the
    day a second framework arrived — the whole expense `.claude/skills/add-framework/` exists to cover, paid
    for a name that was never accurate. Keyed `java-spring` from the start, a sibling is purely additive.
