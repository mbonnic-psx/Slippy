"""`slipwai adopt`: the verb's flags, and what it does with the answers however they arrive.

Experimental (`AGENTS.md` says what the word means here). Run at the root of a repository the factory
did not make. Bare, in a terminal, it surveys the tree, shows every directory that builds as a candidate, asks
the one thing a terminal can answer — where CI runs — and leaves which candidate is an application to `/ground`,
which asks with the code in front of it (ADR 0003; `cli_interview.shape`). With `--yes` nothing is asked and
every proposal is wrapped as `detected`, unlooked-at, and flags override single answers, always `overridden`.
Outside a terminal without `--yes` it refuses rather than guessing.

Two readings of an adoption that has already happened share the verb, because they are the same record read
again rather than a second thing to learn: `--refresh` reconciles a fresh survey with what was recorded, and
`--next` says where the repository stands in the sequence the adoption report named.
