"""What `slipwai adopt` shows and asks in a terminal, and what a flag's answer does to the record.

Experimental (#74; `AGENTS.md` says what the word means here). Split from `cli_adopt`, which owns the parser
and the flags. A terminal is asked one thing — where CI runs, a fact about the forge rather than the code — and
shown the rest: every directory that builds, as a candidate nobody has answered for (ADR 0003). Which of them
is an application, what it is called, what it owns and which of its commands matter are asked by `/ground`,
with the code in front of the agent; a terminal interview that asked all of them, each with Enter as the
default, is how asset bundles and a test suite came to be wrapped as applications on the first monorepo it met.
