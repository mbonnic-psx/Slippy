"""Which coding agent the delivery material is projected into, and how a run can tell without asking.

`./init` installs Spec Kit and projects the canonical `skills/`, `commands/` and `agents/` into one harness's
native locations; `assets/toolkit/scripts/agents/registry.json` is where the thirty-six it knows are declared,
each with the directories it reads them from. That answer has always been `./init`'s question, asked after
`adopt` had already finished — which is one step too late to be any use to an adoption, because the questions
worth handing to a coding agent are asked before there is one.

It is also a question that mostly need not be asked. A run of `slipwai` started from inside a harness is told
so by its environment, and a repository that already has a team's agent in it says which one in the tree. So
this detects, and records the answer the way every other adopted fact is recorded — with where it came from.
What it cannot tell, it leaves `unrecorded` rather than guessing: `./init` still has its own question, and a
thirty-six-row list is a question a terminal has no good way to ask.

Nothing here decides anything. `adopt` records what this returns, and a person's `--integration` outranks it.
