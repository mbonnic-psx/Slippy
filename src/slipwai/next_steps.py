"""`slipwai adopt --next`: where an adoption stands in the sequence `adopt` started, read off the tree.

Brownfield adoption (#74; experimental as `AGENTS.md` defines the word) ends with a report naming what to do
next — `./init`, then `/ground`, then the gate, then the root Makefile — and that report is printed once, into
a terminal, at the end of the longest output the factory produces. It scrolls away. The sequence it names spans
days and four tools, so by the time a step matters its instructions are gone, and `docs/adoption.md`, which
carries the same list, is introduced there as a record of what was wrapped rather than as the plan.

So the plan is not printed and remembered, it is *derived*. Every step in it leaves a mark: Spec Kit writes
`.specify/integration.json`, the first gate run writes the ratchet baseline, `/ground` moves a row's provenance
off `unrecorded`, the root Makefile gains an `-include`, a strategy is an accepted ADR. This module reads those
marks and says which steps are done, which one is next, and why — so the answer to "where was I" is a command
and not a scrollback search. Nothing here writes: it is a reading of the tree and the record, and it is as
right as they are.
