"""How a repository came to have the factory's material, and the facts an adoption recorded about what was there.

A generated project has no origin to speak of: the factory made it, and `project.json` says nothing. An
adopted one — the method installed around code that already existed (experimental as `AGENTS.md`
defines the word) — records `"origin": "adopted"` and, beside the applications it wrapped, what the survey
found and the person confirmed about the repository as a whole: why the work is being done, where the
database schema is versioned, where the deployment infrastructure is described, and what else the tree
carried. Each of the two homes is one of `here`, `elsewhere`, `unmanaged` or `none`, with provenance, and
`elsewhere` names the repository, because that is the one answer the tree cannot give.

Written once by `adopt`, read back by every command that regenerates the manifest — `replay`, `add-service` —
so that the record survives them byte for byte, and read by the pages that explain the adoption.
