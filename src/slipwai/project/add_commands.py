"""The commands about the factory that made this project: `add-service`, `add-frontend`, `catch-up`.

Split from `commands.py` for the reason `native_commands.py` is split from `makefile.py` — that module is at
its budget — and because these are a different kind of command. The others drive a slice through the
project's own workflow; these are about the relationship with the factory. An agent asked for "a payments
service" and given no command will copy `apps/service` by hand and edit the nine files that name it, which
is the state `add-service` exists to end; the command is where it learns that the factory does this, what
has to be decided first, and what to check afterwards.

`catch-up` is the third and at the other end. A migration merges the factory's newer output, and the work
left over is code the factory has never seen being held to a rule that did not exist when it was written.
Left uncommanded that becomes "make verify is red, so change whatever makes it green" — which, faced with a
factory-owned gate script, is exactly the wrong repair. Unlike the other two it runs no factory command:
`slipwai migrate` writes what the versions crossed ask for into the project before it returns, and this reads
it there. One command to run, not two — the second is the one that would be forgotten, because a merge is
visible in `git status` and an obligation is not.

The first two name the project's current applications, so they change when one is added — which means
`add-service` regenerates them, and the file an agent reads always lists what is there now.

# Add service

A service is a change to the list in `project.json` and a regeneration of everything that reads it — the
Makefile, Compose, CI, the workspace, `scripts/verify`, the prose that lists the services. The factory's
`add-service` makes both. Nothing here is copied from `{first.path}` by hand: a copy has to find the nine
files that name it, and misses the tenth.

## What is here

{listed(apps)}

## Decide with the user, not for them

- **Name** — `apps/<name>` and its Compose service: lowercase letters, digits and hyphens, and none of the
  names above.
- **Language and framework** — {default_language}
  Another language beside it is
  `--language {languages}`; a language with more than one framework also takes
  `--framework {"|".join(frameworks)}`.
- **Answers** — one flag per question: {axes}.
  An axis without a flag {inherits} `add-service --help` lists the
  options this project's target allows.
- **Purpose and contexts** — `--purpose "<what it owns, in a sentence or two>"` and `--context <name>`, once
  per bounded context the service holds. The purpose is what `/drive` reads when it decides which service a
  slice belongs to: a service added without one is a directory the loop cannot place work in, and it will
  stop to ask before it does. A context is one already on the list above, or a new one; without any the
  service is a context of its own. A context may span several services; the tree stays `apps/<name>`.
  A service already listed is described after the fact: `<factory> describe-service <name> --purpose "..." --context <name>`.

The language, the store, and what the service owns are product decisions. When the request does not name
them, ask; taking `{first.name}`'s answers is the default for the first two, and saying so is part of
asking. Someone asking for a service has a reason for wanting it separate — the purpose is that reason,
written down. The port is the command's own decision — the next one free — and is not asked.

## Is a service the right shape?

A new bounded context is not by itself a reason for a new service. This project starts as one service that
may hold several contexts as `src/<context>/`, each behind its own `public` module, with `make check-imports`
keeping them apart — and that is where a context whose boundary is still being found belongs. A service is
the right shape when there is a *deployment* reason: its own release cadence, its own scaling or runtime, a
data store of its own, another team, another language. When the request is "a context for X" rather than
one of those, say so, and offer to add `X` to `{first.name}`'s `contexts` in `project.json` instead —
`docs/architecture.md`, *Bounded contexts*, has the three rungs and the reasoning to point at.

- It shares the local backing services with every other service — one `DATABASE_URL`, one database. That is
  right for a walking skeleton and wrong for a product: give it its own database or schema before it owns
  any data, and say so when handing it over.

description: After a migration, work through what the newer factory now asks of code it did not write
---

# Catch up

`slipwai migrate` merges what the factory generates today over what this project has become. What a merge
cannot do is change code the factory never wrote — so a gate that arrived with it can fail code that was
correct on the day it was written, and a rule that arrived with it can contradict a decision this project
already made and recorded. Neither is a mistake by anyone. Both are this command.

Run it after every migration, before the merge is pushed. A migration runs on `main`, on a clean tree — never on a
`slice/<id>` branch, where the host's files it rewrites fall into the slice's diff and `check-slice-scope` refuses them.

## Read what the migration left

`{NOTES}` is written by `slipwai migrate` before it returns — whether the merge committed or stopped at
conflicts — with one section per version this project just took, each with what that version asks of a
repository that already existed. Those sentences were written by the people who made the changes, in the
commits that made them, and this is the only place a project can read them — the factory's `CHANGELOG.md`
is not a file in this repository.

Where the migration could not tell which versions were crossed — a project scaffolded before factory 1.6.0
recorded no version, or both sides were snapshots of one release — the file says so under its own heading
and lists what it can. Read that sentence first: it says how to read the list under it.

If the file is not there, that is not a sign that nothing is owed. Either the migration's report said it
could not be written and why, or the `slipwai` that ran was older than 1.9.0, the version that started
writing it, or no migration has run in this tree. Say which of those it is to the user before anything
else, and read the factory's `CHANGELOG.md` for the versions crossed if you can reach one. Never conclude
from an absent file that the versions crossed asked nothing.

## Then work it

1. Read every **Owes** line. Some ask for something no gate can check — an answer this project has to give,
   a tool to re-run, a step in the account it deploys to. Those are yours to do and nothing will remind you.
2. `make verify`. Take the target it stops at, fix that, run it again, and repeat — one gate at a time,
   because a second failure is often the first one's consequence and disappears with it.
3. Delete `{NOTES}` when the work is done. It is git-ignored and disposable; the factory's changelog is the
   record that lasts.

## Work each failure back to the rule that caused it

A failing gate after a migration is not a bug report; it is a rule arriving. So for each one, say which of
these it is before changing anything, because the right response differs:

- **The rule is right and this project has not done it yet.** The ordinary case. Adopt it: change the code,
  not the gate. `{first.path}` and its siblings are yours to change; the gate script is the factory's.
- **The rule is right and this project already decided the opposite, on purpose.** The decision is written
  down somewhere — a plan, a `tasks.md` line, an ADR — and the migration did not know about it. This is the
  one case that is not yours to settle alone: put the two side by side, the rule and the recorded decision,
  and ask the user which stands. Then write the answer where the next migration will find it.
- **The rule does not fit this project.** Possible, and worth saying out loud rather than working around.
  Say so to the user with the reason, and raise it against the factory. Do not weaken the gate to pass.

{INDEXED}

## Rules

- **Never edit a gate to make it pass.** A gate script came from the factory, the next migration will bring
  it back, and a locally softened copy is a conflict later plus a false green in between. If it is wrong,
  it is wrong for every project the factory made, and it is a change to make there.
- **One rule adopted, one commit.** The migration is already its own commit (two, where the harness
  projections were re-derived). Keeping each adoption separate is what makes a bisect readable afterwards
  and what lets one of them be reverted without the rest.
- **A decision that changes is a decision rewritten.** Where the second case above sends the user's answer
  against something already recorded, edit that record rather than leaving the two to disagree — the next
  person to read it is the next migration's problem otherwise.
- **Green before pushed.** `make verify` passes before the migration and everything after it leaves this
  machine.{PUSH_NOTE if managed(CATALOG, target) else ""}
