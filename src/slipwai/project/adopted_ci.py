"""The gate's CI configuration for a repository the factory did not make, written for the forge found.

An Actions workflow for GitHub and Gitea — the same file, since Gitea and Forgejo run it — that sets up the
toolchains the wrapped applications recorded rather than the ones the catalog knows; a job under the delivery
directory for GitLab, to be included from the repository's own `.gitlab-ci.yml`, which is theirs and is never
written over; and nothing at all for a forge the factory cannot write a job for, or where there is no CI —
`gate_path` says None, and the report says what to run instead. Split from `adopted.py` (brownfield adoption,
experimental as `AGENTS.md` defines the word) when the pages and the CI together passed the module budget.
