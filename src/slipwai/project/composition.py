"""The composition root's half of readiness: which store this project opens, and what `/ready` is given.

`flag_route.py` does this for the flag source; this does it for the event store, and for the same reason.
The HTTP adapter is the same file in every project on a transport — it declares the store structurally and
registers `/ready` — so the *answer* to the event-store question can only arrive where the entry point is
written, which is here.

Three rules shape every string `entry_stores.py` holds, and they are written here because this is where a
reader arrives.

**One store, opened once, by the entry point.** Nothing else in a generated service constructs one: a
module-level store is a second composition root nobody can see, and two of them are two logs.

**The answer sits in its own marked region.** `scripts/backing-services.py --event-store memory` deletes the
chosen adapter, so an entry point that named it unconditionally would stop compiling. The shape is the one
`assets/backing-services/prune.py` describes for an alternative: both states are valid at once — the region
sets the store and the line after it falls back to the in-memory one, so removing the region leaves a
project that still runs, on the store it has left.

**Nothing connects while the process starts.** A service that dies because its database is not up yet gives
a platform a crash loop where it wanted a task reporting "not ready" until the store came back — and it
makes `make smoke-image`, which runs one image with nothing else running, impossible to pass. Two of the
three drivers are lazy already (`pg.Pool`, `pgxpool`); psycopg connects as its connection object is built,
so the Python entry point defers the open to the first probe and keeps the store once one exists.
