"""`./init`: the bootstrap that installs Spec Kit and prunes what the project was not given.

Spec Kit is deliberately absent from a generated repository until this script is run, and the axis flags it
takes are the project's own rather than Spec Kit's, so they are lifted out before the rest is forwarded.
Once it has run, a rerun that forwards nothing — `./init --extension <key>`, a re-answered axis,
`./init --repository <url>` — leaves Spec Kit alone: everything such a rerun does is local or forge-bound,
and reinstalling Spec Kit is the one step that needs to reach its source, so repeating it made every rerun
fail wherever that host is unreachable.

# One extension's `init.py` at a time, in the order given — Python throughout, like every other toolkit

# here, so an extension whose own tool is missing or whose setup fails gets a message, not a failed
# bootstrap. `scripts/extensions/<key>/init.py` is expected to be idempotent and non-fatal itself (see
# docs/extensions.md); this loop only handles a key nothing shipped. `SLIPWAI_INTEGRATION` carries the
# harness chosen on this run to a hook that adds to `skills/` and has to re-project it: Spec Kit records
# the integration for later runs, but a hook running inside the same `./init` cannot rely on that record
# being there yet.
#
# Before the agent projection, the extensions already adopted here are re-projected: an extension that names its
# MCP server in each installed harness's project file has one more file to write when a harness is added later
# (`./init --integration <agent>` on a project that adopted `codegraph` earlier), and Spec Kit has recorded the
# new harness by this point. As non-fatal as everything below.
#
# Then one more projection pass, because that order has a cost: an extension points the agent at itself by
# appending to `AGENTS.md`, and a harness whose `contextMode` is `copy` reads a file Spec Kit wrote from
# `AGENTS.md` before any of this ran. Without the pass its copy never gains the pointer, and the extension
# is installed but never queried. `--context` carries only the marker-fenced regions across — and writes
# the `@AGENTS.md` include an `import` harness reads the whole file through — and it is as non-fatal as the
