"""Which committed read-side asset lands at which path under `apps/service`, per backend.

The other half of `service_layouts.py`, in the same shape and keyed the same way, merged into
`SERVICE_FILES` there. It is a table of its own for the reason that one is a module of its own:
it is most of the bytes and none of the behaviour.

What is here is the machinery a read model is *maintained* with, as opposed to the log it is
derived from — the checkpoint port and its adapters, the catch-up runner, and the two migrations
that create the checkpoint table and the tag index. Every backend gets the same set, because an
asymmetric read side would reproduce the defect this slice exists to fix one level down: whoever
picks the language with less would build the per-request fold nobody chose.

Sources are relative to `assets/backing-services/<backend>/`, and a `../` reaches the material
shared between backends — which is how one `003_projection_checkpoints.sql` serves every SQL
adapter here instead of being written four times.
