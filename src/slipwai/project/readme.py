## Start here

```sh
./init{start_here_production(target)}
make verify
```

`./init` installs Spec Kit for the selected agent; it is not vendored in this repository.{init_production(target)} `make verify` is
the repository's local and CI quality gate. Add one small vertical slice at a time and keep the main branch
releasable.

## Documentation

[`docs/workflow.md`](docs/workflow.md) diagrams the delivery loop each slice travels, from the constitution
through to the hardening passes. [`docs/getting-started.md`](docs/getting-started.md) walks the first slice
end to end{documentation_production(target)}, and [`docs/README.md`](docs/README.md) indexes every page.
"""

## Profile boundary

This standard profile does not adopt Event Modeling or event sourcing. Native Spec Kit cannot
infer that boundary from constitution text you paste: keep the constitution architecture-neutral, or
generate the `event-modelling` profile when those capabilities are intentional. `make verify` rejects a
constitution that mandates event sourcing in this profile.
"""
    if event:
        page_url = event_model_page_url(project_name)
        text += f"""
## Event workflow

Start with `docs/event-model/model.yaml`, name commands and events with domain experts, then implement the
backend event contract and stream identity together in the service the slice belongs to. Event Modeling may
cover the whole user journey, but event sourcing is a backend persistence choice. This profile deliberately
cannot be generated with Event Modeling or event sourcing alone.

### One command runs the loop: `/drive`

```text
/drive          # start the loop, or resume the slice already in flight
/drive S2       # drive a named slice to its demo
```

`/drive` enters at the first incomplete stage proven by durable artifacts, and its ladder starts above the
slice loop: principles, product specification, the event model, the split, then example map, a `/gaps` pass
over it, the installed Spec Kit plan and tasks, implementation, convergence, and the actor-visible demo. Invoking it before the model exists is
a valid start rather than an error — it steps back to the stage that owes an artifact and says so. It never
reruns a completed stage merely to check. It pauses at the demo before hardening so feedback can return to the stage that owns it. Once the
demo is accepted, it runs the mutation pass — plus the adversarial pass when the slice changed attack
surface or closed the split — verifies and archives the slice, and starts the next ready slice without
another invocation. A real product question or unavailable external input is
the other stopping boundary.

`/cruise` runs the same ladder with nobody at the wheel — deciding as the owner, demoing as the actor, recording
both under `specs/` — until the specification is satisfied. It ships switched off: `/cruise-settings enabled=true`,
then `/cruise` in any session starts the runner and watches it; `/cruise-tell` steers it, `make cruise-stop` stops it.

### The browsable model

The event-model workflow renders `docs/event-model/model.yaml` into a zoomable timeline with per-slice
views and embedded wireframe mockups, and publishes it on every push to `main` that touches the model.
Your forge's pages host serves it from the `pages` branch at:

{page_url}

On GitHub the same workflow deploys through GitHub Pages instead; when that URL differs, update
`render.page` in `model.yaml` and the link below. Regenerate locally with `make model` (needs Node).

_Run `make model` after the first modelling session to generate this section._

`apps/` holds one directory per service: {listed}.{browser} Each service has its own language,
framework and backing-service answers, recorded in `project.json`; every one owes the same eight Make
targets (`make help` lists them; every recipe runs for every service), answers a liveness and a readiness
probe on its own port,
and keeps the hexagonal layout `make check-imports` enforces. Which services exist is recorded once, in
`project.json`'s `deployables`; the Makefile, `docker-compose.yml`, the CI workflow,
`scripts/check-imports.py` and `scripts/backing-services.py` read that list, and none keeps a copy.

Add one with the factory that generated this repository, from this directory:

```sh
path/to/slipwai/slipwai add-service <name>                  # the first service's language and answers
path/to/slipwai/slipwai add-service <name> --language python  # another language, its own answers
```

It scaffolds `apps/<name>` with the walking skeleton, adapters and tests a service of that language starts
with, on the next free port, registers it in `project.json`, and regenerates the files that list drives —
the skills' example snippets included, so a second language shows up beside the first at every example.
Say what the service is for while adding it — `--purpose "<what it owns>"` and `--context <bounded
context>`, repeated for each context it holds — because that is what the delivery loop reads when it decides
which service a slice belongs to; `describe-service <name>` takes the same flags for a service already there.
`docs/architecture.md` has the contexts as recorded, and says when a context should become a service.
`add-frontend <name> [--api <service>]` does the same for a browser app, proxying `/api` to the service it
names. Code shared between services goes under `packages/`, and the hexagonal rule applies inside it too;
`docs/architecture.md` says what a shared package is in each language and what each service owes.

knowing first is quicker.

Whether rows 2–{last_checked} are on the machine is checked when the project is generated, too; who the CLI is signed
in as, `make bootstrap` checks before it applies anything. Missing a tool, `./init` still installs Spec Kit,
says which and leaves the push and bootstrap for later — `./init --repository <url>`, or push and
`make bootstrap`. `./init --skip-bootstrap` leaves them deliberately. Once the bootstrap has run, a later
`./init` — to answer an axis again, add an extension, or switch agent — sees its committed state and leaves
the account alone; re-applying the stack is `make bootstrap`, by hand.

`make bootstrap` also asks the one question that decides the bill: whether production is deployed on every
green push, or only when you say so. Answer `n` — or `./init --auto-promote false` — and the pipeline deploys
staging alone, production is never created, and `make promote` is what creates it when you want it. Either
way an environment costs money from the moment it exists;
[`docs/adr/0002-production-target.md`](docs/adr/0002-production-target.md) says how much.

## Production

This project deploys to {CLOUD[target]}, and the pipeline is the way it gets there: every commit that passes `verify` on
`main` runs `.github/workflows/deploy.yml`, which builds one image per service with the ecosystem's own
builder, pushes each by digest, applies `staging`, proves it with `make smoke`, applies `production` and
proves that. It starts when `verify` completes, and only if it passed — never beside it or ahead of it.{site}

Whether that last step runs is the `AUTO_PROMOTE` variable `make bootstrap` wrote to the forge. `true`,
the default, is the pipeline just described. `false` stops it at staging: production is deployed by
`.github/workflows/production.yml` instead, started by `make promote` or from the Actions tab, with the
commit staging is running — and without auto-promotion that first promotion is also what creates
production, so a project pays for one environment until it wants two. Either way production is only ever given the images
staging has already run, and the apply happens on the runner with the deploy role, never on a laptop.
`make bootstrap AUTO_PROMOTE=true` changes this project's mind, in either direction.

When a release is wrong, `.github/workflows/rollback.yml` is started by hand from the Actions tab with the
environment to roll back; it re-applies the release before the current one and proves it the same way.
`infra/` is the whole of the infrastructure — OpenTofu, {words["runtime"]} — [`docs/deployment.md`](docs/deployment.md) draws it for this project's services, and
[`docs/adr/0002-production-target.md`](docs/adr/0002-production-target.md) is why each part is what it is, with what it costs.

```sh
make build smoke-image PLATFORM=linux/arm64   # every service's image, run locally and asked its probe
make deploy ENV=staging                        # what the pipeline does, from a laptop with credentials
make smoke URL=$(make -s url ENV=staging)     # what proves a deploy
make promote                                   # ask the forge to deploy production with what staging runs
make rollback ENV=staging                      # what the rollback workflow does, from a laptop
```

`make bootstrap` is the one thing a person does, once, with administrator credentials the `aws` CLI can
find — `./init` runs it after asking where to push. It applies `infra/bootstrap` — the state bucket, the pipeline's identity, the image repositories — and
configures the repository on the forge from the outputs (variables; and, on a forge without OIDC such as
Gitea, the two secrets of a key that can only assume the deploy role). Run it again after `add-service`.
[`infra/README.md`](infra/README.md) says what it decides and how. `make ci` builds every image and proves
it answers, which is the half of a deploy that can be proved without an account; `tofu validate` is what the
gate holds the stacks to.
