# by `flags.py`, which also emits the reader they name.
FLAG_GUIDANCE = """- **A feature flag is what makes merging and releasing two decisions**, and here it is the only thing
  that does: every commit that passes `verify` on `main` is applied to staging and then to production, with
  nobody in between. Unfinished work therefore ships **dark**. A flag is declared in
  `infra/service/flags.auto.tfvars` under the service that reads it, seeded `off`, in the same change as
  the code that reads it; it reaches that service as `FLAG_<KEY>` — `checkout-v2` is `FLAG_CHECKOUT_V2` —
  and it is read through {readers}, asked by key ({calls}) and nowhere else. Never derive the variable
  name at the point of use and never read the environment for a flag anywhere else: a typo reads as
  absent, absent reads as off, and the feature simply never turns on. Read it where the behaviour branches
  — a use case or an adapter — never in the domain, which takes decided values as inputs the way it takes
  the clock. No service calls {cloud} for a flag.
- **A flag covers a releasable capability, not a slice.** A capability that is not coherent to an actor
  until three slices land wants one flag held off across all three, not three flags — three flags mean two
  states nobody designed, and the first one turned on shows a customer half a feature. One flag stretched
  over unrelated capabilities is the opposite failure: they can then only be released together, and the
  key never gets deleted because something behind it is always unfinished. So **before implementing a
  slice, say which flag gates it and why** — the existing key of a capability this slice continues, or a
  new key because this slice opens one. Recommend the answer with its reason rather than asking an open
  question; ask the user only where it is genuinely undecidable which capability the slice completes,
  which is a product question and never a default. Never add a second flag for a capability that has one.
- **Both paths are tested, and the off path is the one that ships.** While the flag is off, the branch
  running in production is the branch the slice's own tests miss unless they were written — and inserting
  the branch changed that path too, so "it worked before" is not evidence. The reader takes the
  environment as an argument for exactly this reason — which is also why the reader is the only place that
  touches the environment: a bare `FLAG_<KEY>` read at the point of use cannot be driven down both paths,
  so bypassing the reader quietly makes this rule unsatisfiable. `make check-flags` runs inside
  `make verify` and refuses a key declared and never read, a key read and declared nowhere, a new key
  seeded anything but `off`, a key whose tests only ever drive one path, and a read that names the variable
  instead of calling the reader.
- **Before pushing, say what holds the change back from the actor** — the flag key, and that it is `off`.
  If nothing does, because there is no flag or because the flag is already on, **stop and ask the user to
  confirm this is a release they want now**; do not push first and mention it after, and do not decide on
  their behalf that a change is small enough to be safe. There is no later gate at which somebody would
  catch it. A change with no actor-visible behaviour is not a release and needs no flag — say that it is
  one rather than saying nothing.
- `make flag ENV=… KEY=… VALUE=on` writes the value, restarts the service and smokes the environment, so a
  flip costs a rolling restart and no build, no apply and no merge; `make flags ENV=…` prints what an
  environment is set to now, with who set it and when, which is the only place that answer lives — the
  file only seeds a *new* environment, and a flip is not in the release record. A rollback does not turn a
  flag off: `docs/deployment.md` says which undo button is which.
"""

# The other half of that rule, for a project whose flags also have to reach a browser. Two things an author
# cannot work out from the service half: the spelling, and that this side is a build rather than a switch.
BROWSER_FLAG_GUIDANCE = """- The same flag reaches `{web}` as `VITE_FLAG_<KEY>`, and `{web}/src/flags.ts` is the only place that
  transform is written on this side: ask with `flagEnabled('checkout-v2')`, never by reading
  `import.meta.env` at the point of use. Vite inlines the value while the bundle is *built*, so a browser
  flag is a property of the bundle: `scripts/deploy.py` builds it with what this environment's parameters
  are set to at deploy time, and a flag flipped afterwards reaches the browser only on the next `make
  deploy ENV=…` of that environment. `make flag` says so when it flips one this app reads. A flag declared
  under a service other than the one `{web}`'s `/api` goes to does not reach the bundle at all.
- That asymmetry has a window in it, and a direction. On in the service, off in the bundle: the feature is
  invisible and nothing is at risk. Off in the service, on in the bundle: an inviting UI whose every call
  is refused. So turn a feature **on** in the service first and reveal it with the next deploy, and turn it
  **off** in the bundle first — by deploying — before the service stops honouring it. Either way the
  service is the authority: gate the surface on the flag *and* handle the endpoint refusing, because for
  the couple of minutes a restart takes it will. Locally both halves come from `.env`, `FLAG_<KEY>` and
  `VITE_FLAG_<KEY>` set to the same value unless you are deliberately reproducing that window.

CODE_INDEX = """
## Finding your way around this codebase

*Who calls this*, *where else is this symbol used*, and *what breaks if I change it* are answered by
following the call path, not by reading one file. Two skills in `skills/` ask for precisely that —
`debugging` says to search every caller before changing a shared function, and `refactoring` says to inspect
every caller and reachability path before removing a branch — and neither is satisfied by a text search,
which finds the spellings you thought to try and is silent about the rest.

If this file carries an extension block for a code index — `./init --extension codegraph` projects one,
naming `.codegraph/`, `codegraph_explore` over MCP, and the `codegraph` CLI — that index is what answers
those questions, and asking it is the first move rather than the fallback. Each session follows the
block's MCP, installed-CLI, then `npx` order for itself. A fresh delegate does not inherit the parent's MCP
connection, but where it has the CLI on `PATH` it can query the same project index.

A block is not a promise that the index is reachable or current. The database travels with the checkout
and the tooling that serves it does not, and it is only maintained while a client is attached to it — so
follow the block's own detection step first, and where no tool answers, say that and use a text search:
an index you cannot query is an index you do not have. `make check-codegraph` is what notices a database
its tooling has stopped writing to, which otherwise answers *nothing calls that* indistinguishably from
*nothing calls that yet*.

With no such block this project has no index and a text search is the tool. Either way, say which one you
used when you report what you found, so a review can tell an exhaustive answer from a lucky one.
