Reach for the cheapest thing that proves the claim, in this order:

1. **`curl`** for anything the API decides. A status code and a body are the whole claim, and `curl` shows
   both without a browser in the way.
2. **`make test`** for anything a screen renders. A browser app's component tests drive the real component
   with a real user event and no browser at all — see the `react-testing` and `front-end-testing` skills.
3. **A real browser** only when the claim is about the two together: the app calling the service and
   rendering what came back. That is the one thing the levels above cannot prove.

For step 3, Playwright is deliberately **not** a dependency of this project — a browser binary in every
checkout is a cost every contributor pays for something few of them run. Install it when you need it:

```sh
npx --yes playwright install --with-deps chromium   # downloads a browser; --with-deps needs root
npx --yes playwright open {web_url}     # or drive it from a script
```

`skills/front-end-testing/resources/playwright-e2e.md` covers what a browser-level test may and may not
claim before you write one. If browser-level tests become part of the suite rather than a one-off, add
Playwright to `{web_path}` as a devDependency deliberately, in the same commit as the lockfile change, rather
than leaving every future run to `npx`.

is not working yet, ➡️ what comes next — and ends with the literal command or URL, the seed data, the result
to expect in the actor's own words, and a direct question about what using it revealed. This skill exists

action is opening what you just closed, and a dead port is what they find. Say plainly that it is still
running, and on which address.
