"""`.specify/models.json`: which model runs each stage of `/drive`'s ladder, by role — and the section of
`commands/drive.md` that applies it.

Every stage ran on whatever model the harness happened to be set to, at the same price for gauging whether a
slice converged as for turning `examples.md` into tests. The table puts the choice in the project,
versioned with it, keyed by the command each stage runs: `strong` where a stage decides what to build or
whether it was built, `fast` where the input is already fully specified on paper. Roles rather than model
names, because identifiers are provider-specific and go stale; the roles are mapped to identifiers under
`roles`, per harness, in the one place the project owner edits. The split is a hypothesis until benchmarking measures
it, which is why every stage says out loud which model ran it.

`host` is a value, not an absence: the model running `/drive` itself, with no delegation. `strong` maps to it
everywhere, since a strong host handing its judgement stages to a named model would be a downgrade as often
as not. `fast` is seeded only where the identifier is verified — Claude Code's Agent tool takes `sonnet` as an
alias — and is `null` on every other harness that can switch, which `scripts/agents/models.py` reports as "no
identifier mapped" rather than pretending. A harness the registry records no mechanism for gets no row: the
script says every stage runs on the host model there, whatever the table asks.

    return f"""## Who runs each stage

`.specify/models.json` says which model each stage runs on, by role: `strong` where a stage decides what to
build or whether it was built, `fast` where the input is already fully specified on paper — a plan into
tasks, `examples.md` into tests and code, a mutation run. Before running a stage, read its line:

```sh
python3 scripts/agents/models.py implement   # keyed by the command the stage runs; `{layout.make} models` prints them all
```

The line chooses the model; it does not require that model to inherit this session's context. Prefer a fresh
sub-agent whenever the stage can get all of its inputs from artifacts on disk. Six stages are exactly that,
and each is a **named agent type** this project carries in `agents/`, projected into the installed harness by
`{layout.make} agents` with its model and as much of its scope as that harness can enforce:

{types}

`gaps` runs twice and only the pass after implementation is delegated: the pre-planning one may have to ask a
product question, which is the whole reason a stage stays here. Any other conversational stage stays here too,
and has no type for that reason. There is a seventh type, `drive-slice`, for a whole slice rather than a stage:
*Running ready slices concurrently* is where it is delegated, and it reads this section from inside its own
worktree to choose a model for each stage it then runs. The last three rows, `skipper`, `hand` and `bosun`,
are `/cruise`'s: the product owner, the actor and the one who gets a blocked run moving, delegated only when that command is running this ladder on its
own (`commands/cruise.md`). Under `/drive` alone they run nothing; a person is the owner and the actor.

Delegate to the type by name. The type is the standing brief, so the call adds only the task, its contract and
the file manifest — it never describes the role again or restates the scope, and it does not give the delegate
conclusions. It may give it a map: which precedent to copy, which decision in `research.md` governs, which
helper already exists — a file and a section, which the delegate then opens and reads for itself. Naming where
a fact lives is a pointer and costs a sentence; asserting what it says is a conclusion, and a brief that asked
the delegate to read a decision itself and report what it says has caught what a brief that summarised it got
wrong. Where a brief offers a delegate more than one way of working, every permission is written into each
mode that has it, even at the price of a repeated paragraph: a fresh delegate reads a silence conservatively,
and the conservative reading is the expensive one. The page each type is written on is `docs/delegated-agent-safety.md`, the standing boundary every
delegation is held to: reference it, restate none of it (`AGENTS.md`, *Delegated agents*).

**A delegate does not inherit this session's code-index connection.** Where `AGENTS.md` carries the
CodeGraph extension block, three of the types above — `drive-converge`, `drive-gaps` and `drive-adversary` —
are exploration-heavy, and *what does this code not yet do* is a blast-radius question the index answers.
Prefer to run those here when this session has the MCP connection: a fresh delegate does not inherit it.
Delegation is still valid. Its brief says to follow the block in `AGENTS.md`, probe its own MCP, installed
CLI and `npx` routes in that order, and name which route answered. A delegate with the CLI on `PATH` can
query the same project index; it falls back to text search only when all routes are unavailable. Never pass
the parent conversation merely to carry the connection.

Delegate both when the line names another model and when the same strong model can run in a fresh context.
On a harness whose agent file names a model (`scripts/agents/registry.json`, `agentFile`) the type already
carries the one the table resolved; everywhere else set it explicitly through the mechanism the registry
names, and never accept that mechanism's implicit default. If the harness cannot start a fresh sub-agent on
the selected model, run the stage here and say why. Then read its result from disk the way every stage is
read. Either way the stage says, in one line, which type ran it, which model, whether it was delegated and
whether its context was fresh (`drive-implement · model: sonnet · delegated, fresh context` ·
`drive-adversary · model: host · delegated, fresh context` · `model: host, current context — harness cannot
delegate`). Those lines make type, model and context measurable; a stage that switched any of them silently
cannot be compared with one that did not. Nothing about what a stage produces changes with who runs it — the
artifacts, gates and stops are the same — and a sub-agent that meets a product decision hands the
question back here rather than answering it.

**A line may name another harness** — `implement: local → opencode:ollama/qwen-coder-32k — …`. No sub-agent of
this harness can start that, so the stage runs through `python3 scripts/agents/delegate.py <stage> --brief <file>
--allow <path> … --verify "<scoped tests> && <scoped lint and format check>"`. Write the brief to a file — the
task, its contract and the map, exactly as for any delegate — and give one `--allow` per manifest entry, a
directory ending in `/`. The verify command is the stage's quickest relevant tests and the lint and format check
the service's gate runs, both scoped to the manifest's files: a model that is not this one slips on style as
well as behaviour, and a slip caught here is undone now rather than found at the push. Run it in the background where this harness can, since it may take many minutes, and alone: it
reads every change in the tree while it runs as the delegate's, so never beside a concurrent sibling or a second
one. It holds the write scope itself, after the run, because the other harness may not: a run that wrote
outside its manifest, changed nothing, failed its verify command, exited non-zero or ran out of time is undone,
commits included, to exactly where it started. Its last line is `delegate: done — …`, which is the stage line,
or `delegate: failed — …`, which names the fallback: rerun the stage there as an ordinary delegation and say both
(`drive-implement · model: opencode:ollama/qwen-coder-32k failed (wrote outside its manifest), rerun on sonnet ·
delegated, fresh context`) — how often the first half happens is what the mapping is measured by. A run that
is kept is not taken at its word on RED: read its log, whose path is on that last line, for a failing run of the
new tests before the passing one, and add `RED observed` or `RED not observed` to the stage line and
`red=observed` or `red=not-observed` to its benchmark entry. It is recorded, not enforced — a log shows what
was printed, not the order the work was done in — so the count is a measure of the mapping, never a reason to
undo a run whose tests pass. Only a stage whose type may run any command is ever sent there; `models.py --check`
refuses a table that would send another.

A stage is not always one delegate. Before delegating implementation, read `tasks.md` for its `[P]` markers and
its *Parallel opportunities* section: the tasks command writes both, and they are the plan for what may run
alongside what — written by one half of this workflow to be read here, not decoration. Every unchecked `[P]`
task whose files are disjoint from the batch already running is a concurrent sibling, delegated in the same turn
with a manifest of its own — and so is a task with no marker whose manifest shares no file with the batch. The
marker is the tasks command's reading of production-code contention, and it under-reports: one slice's list
marked one pair concurrent, said of the rest "none, by construction", and left two pairs that shared no file
to run in sequence. The manifests are the artifact; read them, and let only an overlap with a running
sibling's files, or what the section rules out, keep a task waiting. How many rules one delegate is handed
— a task, a rule or a user story — and how many RED tests each cycle opens with are `.specify/drive.json`'s
two settings (*How implementation is delegated* below), said in the stage line and put on the record. What the
section rules out stays sequential whatever the markers seem to allow — a RED-GREEN-REFACTOR increment starts
from a green, committed suite, and two of them at once is the batched-tests anti-pattern with a `[P]` on it.
The siblings are `drive-implement` delegates, and that type is where the rule they cannot infer for
themselves already lives: **no concurrent delegate writes `tasks.md`**. It is the one file every sibling would
otherwise contend for, so each reports which task it finished and this session ticks the checkbox.

When several delegates form one batch, report once when the batch completes rather than once per delegate.
Verify their claims by spot-checking the recorded reproduction or RED evidence; do not repeat each complete
investigation in the host context. Do not re-investigate. A delegate that was stopped has filed nothing:
everything in its stop notification is a lead, never a result, and a lead is re-run before it is written
anywhere outside this session. An adversary pass is the same kind of batch:
disjoint-manifest seams of one pass are concurrent `drive-adversary` siblings in one turn, and the host
writes the log after the batch rather than re-attacking. It records the type and the explicit model that
ran each seam in `specs/<feature>/adversary-log.md`, especially when seams use different models.

The table is the project owner's to change at any point, and it is read before every stage rather than once,
so a change takes effect at the next stage — and rewrites the agent types, which carry the model on every
harness that reads one from a file: `/model-delegation-settings implement=strong claude.fast=haiku` edits it checked
(`commands/model-delegation-settings.md`, over `python3 scripts/agents/models.py --set`), or edit the file by hand and let
`make check-agents` hold the shape. When the owner asks for a different model at a stage, `/model-delegation-settings` is the
change — not a note, and not a switch made silently in the delegation. Commit the file: the choice is versioned with the project, and `slipwai
migrate` merges a newer factory's table over it rather than replacing it.

# Model delegation settings

`.specify/models.json` says which model runs each stage of `/drive`'s ladder, by role — `strong` where a
stage decides what to build or whether it was built, `fast` where the input is already fully specified on
paper — and what each role maps to on the harness this project is initialised for. This command is how the
table is read and how it changes: as and when, in one step, checked, and never by quietly picking a different
model inside a delegation.

## No argument — show the table

```sh
python3 scripts/agents/models.py
```

Report it as printed: the installed harness, whether it can choose a model for a sub-task at all and how
(`scripts/agents/registry.json`, `subagentModel`), then each stage's role, the model or the host model, and
why. No harness installed is a line of its own — `./init --integration <agent>` records one.

## Arguments — change it

Each argument is one of two edits, and the first thing to decide is which one the person means:

- `stage=role` moves a stage between roles — `implement=strong` puts implementation back on the model running
  `/drive`. The keys are the commands the ladder runs: `principles`, `specify`, `event-model`, `split`,
  `example-map`, `gaps`, `release-constraint`, `plan`, `tasks`, `implement`, `converge`, `demo`, `adversary`,
  `mutation`, the three `/cruise` delegates `skipper`, `hand` and `bosun`, and `default` for any stage without a row of
  its own.
- `harness.role=identifier` changes what a role runs on — `claude.fast=haiku`, or `claude.skipper=opus` to
  put a bigger model on `/cruise`'s product decisions than on driving. `host` is the model running `/drive`;
  `null` is no identifier mapped, which the line before each stage then says.
- `harness.role=<other harness>:<model>` sends a role's stages to another harness entirely —
  `claude.local=opencode:ollama/qwen-coder-32k`, a local model through opencode — run by
  `scripts/agents/delegate.py`, which undoes a run that fails. Give it a role of its own (`implement=local`),
  since only stages whose type may run any command may go there, and say what a failed run reruns on with
  `fallbacks.<role>=<role>` (`fallbacks.local=fast`); with none, it reruns on the host model.

Pass them through exactly as given:

```sh
python3 scripts/agents/models.py --set $ARGUMENTS
```

It rewrites the agent types as it goes: `agents/drive-<stage>.md` is projected into the installed harness
with the model this table resolves, so a change here that left them behind would take effect on one harness
and not another, and `make check-agents` would report drift in a file nobody edited. The line saying so is
part of the output; report it.

The script refuses a stage the ladder does not have, a harness the registry does not know or records no
mechanism for, and any change that would leave the table malformed — and writes nothing then. Report a refusal
in its words; do not work around it by editing the file. A role a stage newly names is added as `null` under
every harness: say so, and ask for the identifier rather than inventing one.

Then show the line for each stage the change touches (`python3 scripts/agents/models.py implement`) and commit
`.specify/models.json` on its own, with a message naming the change. The choice is versioned with the project,
and a change buried in a slice's commit is a change nobody finds.

## When the request is in words

"Use the cheap model for implementation" is two possible edits, and the identifier is the part not to guess.
Where the harness's mechanism takes an alias the registry names (`identifiers` under its `subagentModel`), use
that spelling; otherwise ask which identifier, since model names are provider-specific and go stale. Never map
a role for a harness this project is not initialised for, and never for one the registry says cannot switch —
the script refuses the second, and the first is a setting nothing reads. A change takes effect at the next
stage `/drive` runs; nothing already running is interrupted. `{layout.make} models` prints the same table.
