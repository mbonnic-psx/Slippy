"""Big issues that are quick wins: what the survey can see in a tree that is cheap to fix and expensive to leave.

Brownfield adoption (experimental as `AGENTS.md` defines the word). The second real adoption carried a
third-party API key as a string literal in a Java source file, an in-memory `admin` password in a Spring Security
XML, and an IDE's whole `.idea/` directory under version control, and the method said nothing about any of it
while it talked about ladders. This module reads for the handful of things that are both — a secret in the tree,
IDE and build output tracked, a dependency repository fetched over plain HTTP, a lockfile the package manager
would have written but nobody committed, a binary archive tracked — and says each with the file that shows it and
the fix, never the value: a secret's value is not written anywhere by this factory, and the fix for one begins
with rotating it, because a key in history is public.

Each finding is a proposal and nothing is changed: the adoption's report lists them, `survey/survey.md` carries
them under *Big issues that are quick wins*, and `/drive`'s Convergence stage offers them ahead of the map's rows
while any remain. `/survey` reads the tree again, so a finding disappears when the tree stops showing it — that is
how they are tracked, without a ledger to tick.
