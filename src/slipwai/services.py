"""Which applications a generated project has: one list, read by everything that names one.

A generated repository is a monorepo, and the list of applications it holds is one fact: written into
`project.json` as `deployables`, built here for the generator, and iterated over by every file that has to
name a service — the Make recipes, the Compose file, the CI job, the import gate and the pruner.

Two kinds of application, told apart by `kind`: a **service** is a backend deployable that owes the eight
Make targets, a `/health` probe and the hexagonal layout; a **web** app is a browser frontend, which owes
none of those and is never a service, and names the service its `/api` calls go to. Each service carries its
own `language`, `framework` and `selection` — a project may hold a TypeScript service on Fastify and Postgres
beside a Python one on FastAPI and SQLite — and a project may hold several browser apps, each proxying to a
service of its choice. Everything project-wide (the Makefile, Compose, CI, `.gitignore`, the pruner, the
prose) is the union of what its applications say, computed by the helpers below rather than by any part
asking "the project's language" or "the frontend".

The first service is `apps/service` and the first browser app `apps/web` unless the generation named them
otherwise; either way the first of each kind is the one `make dev`, `PORT` and every document that has to
name one application speak of. Later ones are `apps/<name>`, each on the next port of its kind.

A service also carries what it is *for*: a `purpose` in a sentence or two, and the bounded `contexts` it
holds. Neither changes a scaffolded byte; both exist so the delivery loop can place work. A context may span
several services; a service may hold several as `src/<context>/` — the modular monolith a project starts as —
and one that names none is its own. Once a service holds more than one, the import gate keeps them apart and
the model gate makes every slice say which one it is in; the manifest field is what both read.
