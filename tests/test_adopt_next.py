"""`slipwai adopt --next`, and the intro questions a terminal cannot answer well.

The adoption report names a sequence — `./init`, `/ground`, the gate, the root Makefile, a strategy ADR —
that takes longer than one sitting, and prints it once, at the end of the longest output the factory
produces. What is gated here is that the sequence is *derived* rather than remembered: every step leaves a
mark on the tree, so `--next` reads the marks and says where somebody is, and keeps saying it correctly as
the marks appear. Gated beside it is the terminal intro that asks nothing per directory, and the switch it
arrived behind, which is still accepted and now chooses nothing.
