"""A wrapped application begins as a candidate (ADR 0003), and the gate refuses until one is confirmed.

What is gated here is the distinction the record gained: `deployables` says what somebody has established,
`candidates` says what was merely found, and nothing moves from one to the other without a person or an
agent saying so. The terminal asks the one question a terminal can answer; `verify` refuses rather than
passing over nothing; `--confirm` builds the entry and regenerates everything that reads it; declining
records nothing in its place. `--yes` is the unattended path it has always been, and says nobody looked.
