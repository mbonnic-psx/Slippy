"""The pointer at a project's code index: where it is, what it claims, and which skills may carry it.

`./init --extension codegraph` installs a local code-knowledge graph and, per `docs/extensions.md`, appends
a marker-fenced pointer to `AGENTS.md`. That obligation was met and the index still went unused, for a
reason worth gating rather than remembering: `./init` can only *append*, so the block landed below the
closing line of the file and was the only place in a generated project that named the index at all — while
the two skills asking for exactly the operation it performs said nothing about how to perform it, which
sends a reader to a text search by omission.

So the factory carries its own half now, and this suite is what stops the two halves from drifting apart.
The generated section names two skills; if either stops saying what it is quoted as saying, the section is
telling every project something false, and that is a failure here rather than a puzzle downstream.

The other half is a boundary. Ten skills under `assets/toolkit/skills/` are vendored third-party at pinned
upstream commits with their own `LICENSE`; an edit to one is a conflict on every refresh, for a pointer
`AGENTS.md` already carries. That the factory's own skills may name the index and licensed ones may not is
the rule, written here where it is enforced instead of only in prose.
