"""`slipwai adopt --confirm` and `--decline`: a candidate becomes an application, or stops being a question.

Split from `test_candidates`, which gates the state itself — what `adopt` records, what the gate does while
nothing is confirmed, and where the sequence says you are. This is the command that settles one: what it
writes, what provenance it carries, what it refuses, and what it leaves alone.
