"""The service side of a feature flag: the reader every backend gets, and the gate that holds it.

A flag is the only thing between a merge and a customer under a production target — every commit that
passes `verify` on `main` is applied to staging and then to production — so the constitution requires that
unfinished work arrive dark, behind a flag, with tests on both paths. Until this existed the browser half
was designed and the service half was a sentence in `AGENTS.md`: no reader, no key-to-variable transform,
no seam to inject, and therefore no both-path testing.

What is proved here is each of those, in the order they depend on each other: that every backend gets a
reader that spells one key one way and treats everything but `on` as off, that `--target none` gets none of
it, that `make check-flags` catches each of the five failures it exists for, and that the rule an author is
held to points at the file rather than describing the convention.

The fifth is a pair rather than a rule on its own, and both halves are proved: a read that names `FLAG_<KEY>`
instead of calling the reader is still *seen* as one, so the dead-configuration rule cannot be fooled by it,
and is *reported*, so that allowance does not become permission to bypass the reader.
