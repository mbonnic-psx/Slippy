"""`/ground`: the question set the tree cannot answer, asked by the agent one row at a time and recorded.

What this gates: only an adopted repository gets the command; it opens with the map as it stands, so a refresh
regenerates it with the record; every axis is asked with its rungs and their meanings except the constitution,
which only the gate establishes; each answer has a place in the record and `confirmed` provenance; "I don't
know" stays unrecorded; the tree wins over an answer it contradicts; and `/drive`'s Ground stage, the hook, the
adoption page and the report all send the person to it. Experimental, with the rest of adoption (experimental).
