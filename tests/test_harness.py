"""Which coding agent the delivery material is projected into, and how a run establishes it without asking.

`./init` has always asked, after `adopt` had already finished — one step too late to be any use to the
adoption, since the questions worth handing to an agent are asked before there is one. It is also mostly
answerable without asking: the environment a run started in says so, a repository whose team already uses one
says so in the tree, and once `./init` *has* asked, Spec Kit's own record is a person's answer rather than
anybody's reading. What none of them says stays `unrecorded`, because a thirty-six-row list is not a question
a terminal can ask well and a tree that reads for two harnesses names neither.
