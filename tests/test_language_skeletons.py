"""A backend's walking skeleton is an asset, not a string literal in the generator.

`assets/` is the single source for everything generated — the claim the README opens with. A skeleton file
inlined in code is that claim being false in the one place hardest to notice, because the file still
appears in the output and only the *editing* of it moved somewhere else. These tests read the asset tree
and require the generated project to match it, so a skeleton that stops coming from disk stops passing.
