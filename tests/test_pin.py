"""The Pin stage of adoption: `/characterise`, `/survey`, and the `adopt --refresh` the second one runs.

Experimental (`AGENTS.md` says what the word means here). Two commands only an adopted repository gets,
and one rule under which a fresh survey meets the record: a fact that was only detected follows the tree, a
fact a person decided is never changed behind their back but put beside what the tree now says, and a
directory that starts building is reported, not adopted. The files the record drives follow the record, and
nothing is committed.
