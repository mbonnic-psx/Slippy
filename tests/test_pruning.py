        what happens when a file is missing from it: nothing, quietly. The region survives the prune, and
        the feature reads as still present in a project that no longer has it — which is the worst shape a
        bug in a prune can take, because `--list` then offers an answer that cannot be given.

        backend, cannot be missing either — and so that a backend whose paths carry a project-derived
        directory name (a Python package, a Java package) finds out here rather than in a generated repo.
